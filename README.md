# Password Generation Using Python

## Overview
This project provides a password generation tool using Python. The system generates secure, random passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. It is designed to help users create strong passwords to enhance their online security.

## Features
- Generate random passwords of specified length.
- Include special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.
- Command-line interface for easy usage.
- Configurable password parameters.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generation-python.git
    cd password-generation-python
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the password generation script:
    ```bash
    python generate_password.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to specify the password criteria (length, inclusion of special characters, etc.).

## Customization
To customize the password generation logic, follow these steps:
1. Open `config.py` and modify the settings as needed.
2. Update the `generate_password.py` script to implement additional features or change the password generation algorithm.
